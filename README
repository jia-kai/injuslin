  What is it?
  -----------

  Injuslin is short for "INformatics JUdge System for LINux".
  It is used to judge infomatics contests.

  There are already many programs of the same kind, but injuslin has
  the following features:
	1. Secure.  By default, it runs contestant's programs using
	   the user nobody. Chroot environment is also supported
	   (see ./configure --help). It is almost impossible for a contest's
	   program to damage the judge system.
	2. Efficient. Injuslin can automatically configure a contest (looking
	   for problems and input and output files). And judge mode is of
	   CUI(console user interface), so you can kill all the unnessesary
	   programs, including X, to minimize other programs' effect to
	   contests' programs.

  Thanks for choosing injuslin! Enjoy!
